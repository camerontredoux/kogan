  <p>Kōgan is a Discord bot used for my private Discord server. It provides anime statistics using the Kitsu API, and allows users in my server to track their favorite anime. They can then receive updates and countdowns for anime releases, and information on individual episodes. Kōgan uses <a href="https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity">serenity</a>, a Discord API wrapper written in Rust.</p>

  <h5>Kōgan is rōmaji for the Japanese translation of "testicles". This is an inside joke from my server.</h5>
