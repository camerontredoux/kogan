  <p>Kōgan is a Discord bot used for my private Discord server. It provides anime statistics using the Kitsu API, and allows users in my server to track their favorite anime. They can then receive updates and countdowns for anime releases, and information on individual episodes. Kōgan uses <a href="https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity">serenity</a>, a Discord API wrapper written in Rust.</p>

<code><bold>Features</bold></code>

  <h6>info - gathers data for anime using the kitsu.io API, displaying relevant anime information as an embed.</h6>
  <h6>trending - displays a paginated message that cycles through this week's top 10 anime.</h6>

  <h6><em>More coming soon!</em></h6>

  <h5>Kōgan is rōmaji for a Japanese word... this is an inside joke :)</h5>
